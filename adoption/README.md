# Pre Launch Adoption

The latest crypto bull run has benefited the blockchain ecosystem immensely. One of the benefits is the rise of NFT's. I think NFT's can offer gamified on-boarding. When a user creates a HIVE account, they can provide a referrer. Accounts can be created to mint NFT's based on the referrer. If someone reffers @benny.blockchain, they can receive a benny.blockchain NFT. Accounts can be created for Cold Brew early adopter or anything else that can be marketed. The meshing of ETH with NFT's would broaden Cold Brew to the Ethereum community. NFT's have no fungible value so the value is still created on HIVE, not Ethereum.

## IDO

Projects offering launch pad services are fantastic for early funding. [THORChain](https://thorchain.org) and [0.exchange](https://0.exchange) are examples of communities attracting a large amount of liquidity. These projects are multi-chain dex's which means that HIVE can participate.
