# Social Features

Hivemind is the social network open source feature of HIVE. It offers features like following, tags, and communities. Hivemind can be found on the [HIVE GitLab](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive) page. Hivemind streams the blockchain from hived through JSON-RPC calls. A SQL database is kept to index posts, accounts, and communities. This can be done similarly or we can build upon Hivemind. HIVE posts have a metadata field that can include any information that we would want indexed.
