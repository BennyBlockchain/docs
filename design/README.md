# Design
The design of Cold Éƒrew was made on the fly. Components are styled using Bootstrap 5.0 and React-Bootstrap. The plan for the coming months is to work with my designer and make a component library with Cold Brew design specifications. Cleans up the repo and makes UI development independant with logic.

## Library
styled-components
ANT? Bootstrap? Material Design?
TypeScript, would prefer
